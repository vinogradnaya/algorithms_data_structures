/*
 used for:
 - cycle detection in DAGs
 - in garbage collection - all vertices that are not marked are subject to removal from memory
 - find path maze
 - does path exist
 - connected components
 - strongly connected components in Digraph (NOT acyclic) - Two vertices v and w are strongly connected if they are mutually reachable: that is, if there is a directed path from v to w and a directed path from w to v. A digraph is strongly connected if all its vertices are strongly connected to one another. We use Kosaraju algo to find strongly connected components
 
 - is bipartite?
